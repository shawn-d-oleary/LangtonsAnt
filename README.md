# LangtonsAnt
Langton's Ant Coding Exercise!

Please check out the LangtonsAnt project for the C++ solution

If interested, you may also check out LangtonsAntCSharp for an alternative solution to the problem. 
In this version of the project, I wrote data to a json file and also wrote a web page with jQuery/javascript to read the json and output a canvas.
This was more involved than outputting the ant's path to the console but provides a much better visualization of the path from start to finish. 
A future enhancement is to animate the ant's movements on the canvas so we can see where the ant re-traced its steps rather than only the ending square colors.
